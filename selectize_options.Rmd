## Introduction
Let's not beat around the bush here, shiny's default [`selectInput()` and `selectizeInput()`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.6.0/selectInput.html) come with a few nice functionalities which you might find useful. But sometimes you may wish to tweak them a little to suite some specific needs.

After a little thinking you decide to start with the usual `?selectInput` to view shiny's documentation. Under `options` arg they hit you with the 

> ... See documentation of `selectize.js` for possible options...

When I was a beginner in shiny nothing used to scare me more than being referred to a JavaScript library. Which is why you're here in the first place. You're scared. Aren't you?

So, what are we going to discuss? 

- [Add remove button]

- [Set max items]

- [Change the height of selectize list]

Most of these tips come in handy especially when you've set the argument `multiple = TRUE` and they're super easy to implement.
Alright, let's diiive right in!


## Add remove button
The default `selectizeInput()` looks something like this:
```{r}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  selectizeInput(
    inputId = "defaultSelectizeInput", 
    label = "Default Selectize Input", 
    choices = LETTERS, 
    selected = LETTERS[1:3], 
    multiple = TRUE
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
That's just okay, but my main issue is how is a user supposed to know that after making a selection they can tap on their backspace to delete it? According to me it's supposed to be more obvious than that.

To add that functionality all you have to do is add this little code chunk to your `selectizeInput()`:
```{r}
options = list(
      plugins = list("remove_button")
    )
```

So our initial `selectizeInput()` now becomes:
```{r}
selectizeInput(
    inputId = "removeButton", 
    label = "Selectize Input with Remove", 
    choices = LETTERS, 
    selected = LETTERS[1:3], 
    multiple = TRUE, 
    # ----this:----
    options = list(
      plugins = list("remove_button")
    )
  )
```

And Voila! If you want to see more magic stick with me to the end.


## Set max items
After seeing what we did above you can already guess what this part will look like. All we want to do is make sure the user doesn't select more than 4 items (I chose 4 because why not!). You just have to add this code inside your `selectizeInput()`:
```{r}
options = list(
      maxItems = 4
    )
```
So your `selectizeInput()` now looks like this:
```{r}
selectizeInput(
    inputId = "setMaxItems", 
    label = "You can only choose 4", 
    choices = LETTERS, 
    selected = LETTERS[1:3], 
    multiple = TRUE, 
    # ----this:----
    options = list(
      maxItems = 4
    )
  )
```

And now a user can't make more than 4 selections.

## Change the height of selectize list
By default `selectizeInput()` will list around 7-8 options on the screen if your choices are many. This might be too many or too few for your liking. So how do you add or reduce the number of choices displayed? Easy peasy! You just have to add this piece of code anywhere in your shiny app body:
```{r}
# Reduce height of selectize input:
tags$style(
        type='text/css', ".selectize-dropdown-content {max-height: 100px; }"
      )
# Alter the max-height to your liking!
```
*Note: That changes the height of every `selectizeInput` in your app. (Sorry, did you shoot yourself on the foot? Maybe.)*

A sample application here would look like this:
```{r}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$style(
    type='text/css', ".selectize-dropdown-content {max-height: 100px; }"
  ), 
  
  selectizeInput(
    inputId = "shorterSelectizeList", 
    label = "Shorter height selectize input", 
    choices = LETTERS, 
    selected = LETTERS[1:3], 
    multiple = TRUE
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

If you're using `{shinydashboard}`:
```{r}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)

ui <- dashboardPage(
  header = dashboardHeader(
    title = "Selectize Input"
  ), 
  
  sidebar = dashboardSidebar(
    
  ), 
  
  body = dashboardBody(
    tags$style(
      type='text/css', ".selectize-dropdown-content {max-height: 100px; }"
    ), 
    
    selectizeInput(
    inputId = "shorterSelectizeList", 
    label = "Shorter height selectize input", 
    choices = LETTERS, 
    selected = LETTERS[1:3], 
    multiple = TRUE
  )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, server) {
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)

```


## DRY?
So far so good, right? Right. But Mwavu, great R programmers like [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) emphasize the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). Setting those options on every `selectizeInput` is kinda wet... Yunno, not dry. (God, I'm so funny. Ha. Ha.) How do you avoid that? Simple. Use a function.
```{r}
selectizeOptions <- function(n = NULL) {
  if (!is.null(n)) {
    return(
      list(
        'plugins' = list('remove_button'),
        maxItems = n
      )
    )
  }

  list(
    'plugins' = list('remove_button')
  )
}
```
What does the above function do?

1. Checks if you have supplied the argument `n` (max items user can select). If yes, it adds two functionalities to your `selectizeInput`: Adds an `x` beside each selected option which when pressed deselects the option & max number of items user can select.

2. If `n` isn't given, it adds only one functionality to your `selectizeInput`: Adds an `x` beside each selected option which when pressed deselects the option.


How do we use the function in an application? Call it in the `selectizeInput`s you want to customize. 
I have a small reprex app below:
```{r}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)

selectizeOptions <- function(n = NULL) {
  if (!is.null(n)) {
    return(
      list(
        'plugins' = list('remove_button'),
        maxItems = n
      )
    )
  }
  
  list(
    'plugins' = list('remove_button')
  )
}

ui <- dashboardPage(
  header = dashboardHeader(
    title = "Selectize Input"
  ), 
  
  sidebar = dashboardSidebar(
    
  ), 
  
  body = dashboardBody(
    tags$style(
      type='text/css', ".selectize-dropdown-content {max-height: 100px; }"
    ), 
    
    selectizeInput(
      inputId = "steroidSelectizeInput", 
      label = "selectizeInput on steroids!", 
      choices = LETTERS, 
      selected = LETTERS[1:3], 
      multiple = TRUE, 
      options = selectizeOptions(n = 4)
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, server) {
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)

```


There are other plugins & extensions you can use to further customize your `selectizeInput` but those 3 have proved to be the most useful to me.
