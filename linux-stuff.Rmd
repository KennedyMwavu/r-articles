## To & From Root User
To switch from normal user to root user:
```
sudo su -
```

To switch from root user to normal user:
```
su - <username>
```

For example:
```
su - mwavu
```

`su` is the linux command for *Switch User*.

## mwavu@mwavu-pc
This is the same as `<user>@<name of pc>`.

That's why there's:

- `postgres@mwavu-pc` when I switch user to postgres.
- `root@mwavu-pc` when I switch to root user.

## sudo apt-get update
Checks for available updates of installed packages. It compares the version of the installed packages to the version of the ones in the remote repo.

- `Hit`: No newer version
- `Ign`: Ignore
- `Get`: There's a newer version

## sudo apt upgrade
Run this after `sudo apt-get update`. It downloads and installs the packages with 
newer versions.

What if you run it before `sudo apt-get update`? Well, there could be a newer version of a  package and the system wouldn't know so it wouldn't update.
