## To & From Root User
To switch from normal user to root user:
```
sudo su -
```

To switch from root user to normal user:
```
su - <username>
```

For example:
```
su - mwavu
```

`su` is the linux command for *Switch User*.

## mwavu@mwavu-pc
This is the same as `<user>@<name of pc>`.

That's why there's:

- `postgres@mwavu-pc` when I switch user to postgres.
- `root@mwavu-pc` when I switch to root user.
